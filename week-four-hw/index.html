			<h1>How to Make Macarons</h1>
			<img class="col-12" src="./assets/img/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
			<p>So, you want to make macarons and you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you are saying grasshopper? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Aliquid animi voluptatem corrupti ex dignissimos quasi facilis fuga aliquam, fugit, temporibus alias rem blanditiis. Nobis eveniet pariatur debitis odit, repudiandae architecto?</p>
			<div class="ingredients">
				<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<p>For the macaron shells you will need:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>3/4 Cup almond meal/flour</li>
					<li>1 Cup confectioner's sugar</li>
					<li>2 Large egg whites</li>
					<li>A pinch of cream of tartar</li>
					<li>1/4 Cup caster sugar</li>
					<li>Food coloring</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="recipe">
				<h2>These are your first steps...</h2>
				<ol>
					<img src="./assets/img/eggs-main.jpg" alt="">
					<li>If you have not already done so, seperate the egg whites from the yolk into a mixing bowl by cracking an egg in half and gently "passing" the insides from one half-shell to another and letting it goop into the bowl. The recipe says to use aged egg whites but from my experience it's not a problem if they're not.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/macaron-4.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Use an electric mixer to mix the egg whites until it gets foamy. From there add a pinch of cream of tartar. And then keep mixing until it starts forming soft peaks.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/img_5056.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Now, slowly start adding the 1/4 Cup of caster sugar to the egg whites and continue to mix until all the sugar is fully incorporated and stiff peaks form. Also, add food coloring during this if desired. Set aside.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/batter-steps-2.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Take the almond meal and confectioner's sugar and dump it into a food processor. Mix the ingredients for about minute. Then use a sieve the sift the almond meal/sugar mixture into a seperate bowl. You can use a spatula to help with the sifting process. Pour the mixture into the processor again and repeat. The more times you repeat this, the finer the mix will be and the macarons will be smoother. Two or three times is good. When finished, pour into a large mixing bowl.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/fold.jpg" alt="">
					<li>This is the sort of difficult part. In order to make good macaron shells, the consistency of the batter needs to be just right. Mix it too much and the batter becomes runny and flattens out and sucks. Too little and I don't remember what happens. Anyway, take the egg white mixture and dump that into the large mixing bowl with the almond meal mix. Using a spatula, scoop from the bottom and fold the mixture. Do this about 50 times. After 3-4 folds, it'll start to have a more batter-like consistency. You want it to be like lava. Or magma. You can check by scooping some with the spatch and letting it droop back into the bowl. If it's really slow and chunks, keep going. If it's kind of slow but has a consistent ribbon stream, that's good. Don't let it good too fast.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/pipe.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Transfer the batter into a piping bag or ziploc bag if you don't have any. Just cut the corner off in an arc kind so you get a circlular hole. Place a some baking parchment on a cookie sheet and pipe out some batter. Make them however large you want. 1 1/2 inch diameter is a good average size.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/rest.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Let the batter rest for at least 45 minutes until the shells lose their shine and become dull.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/oven.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and drop it to 325 when you put the cookies in. Bake on middle rack for 5 minutes. Then turn the sheet around and bake for another 5 minutes.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/bottom.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Pull out and let cool for a few minutes. Then seperate. If the cookies come right off the parchment and they are not burnt, good job! If not, then something went wrong and oh well.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/filling.jpg" alt="">
					<li>Make filling and sandwich the cookies with the filling.</li>
					<img src="./assets/img/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">
					<li>That's it!</li>
