				<h3><a href="#">Those who teach, learn.</a></h3>
				<p>At Porky Pig, we take pride in our work teaching others and sharing what we've learned. Whether by speaking at a conferene, leading a class, or writing on this very blog, we've taught or shared our knowledge on best practicies for web design and development, user expereience design, business advice, and even the occasional informal primer on animated GIFs.</p>
				<p>When someone at Porky Pig tells me that they're teaching a class for a website or a local university, or a workshop at a conference, my first response to them is one of encouragement.</p>
				<p>Then, I say: <strong>The best way to get better at what you do is to teach others how to do it, too.</strong></p>

				<h2>About</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="section-contents">
				<p class="text-red">We've been designing digital experiences ever since the web existed. And that tentire time we've stayed ahead of the curve.</p>
				<p>An inspirtational leader in the digital design industry, Elmer Fudd, crowned the "King of Wascally Wabbits" by Looney Tunes and the first inductee to the SXSW Interactive Festival Hall of Fame, founded Porky Pig in 1999. Porky Pig has grown to become an industry-leading, diverse group of problem-solving superstars across the studios, united under the common goal of making the web a better place to think, work and play. At Porky Pig, we openly share knowledge rather than tuck it away for some secret strategic advantage. An industry that shares information makes a better industry. Weseek every opportunity to write, teach, and speak about what we do, and that's a big reason why our clients come to us.
				<br>As Porky Pig continues to evolve, we'll always be looking for ways to make digital communication, and the business that surrounds it, as meaningful and enjoyable as it can be.</p>
